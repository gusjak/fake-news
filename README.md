## Code Review
From **Erik White**

1. Good with several CSS files. Feel very structured. If anything could be added here, it could be a folder for them all.
2. Great idea with a function to find the most liked article! Even if not currently active.
3. Functions overall looks short and clean.
4. Noticed a minor (maybe?) mistake on article "Battery life...". Word 'Eitherin' should maybe be 'Either in'?
5. Overall I like the look of the site and it feels well put together, and nice extra with the JS.
